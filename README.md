Avoid distractions from Android wear during driving with Undistract.

Disclaimer: This application is still in very early development stage.

Blacken your Android watch in three ways:
1. Set up a Bluetooth device, that will trigger screen blacking on connection. Very useful when set up with your car Bluetooth.
2. Tap the manual blackening button in the Undistract phone app.
3. Launch Undistract from your watch.
